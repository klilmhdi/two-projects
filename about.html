          <h1>What SEL Is, Why It Matters</h1>
          <p>
            See why learning
            social-emotional skills
            is just as important as
            learning reading,
            writing, and math.
            Watch how early and
            continued SEL
            instruction can have
            long-lasting benefits
            for kids and adults.

      <h1>The Purpose of SEL: Let's Be Clear</h1>
      <p>Social-emotional learning isn't just a
        feel-good activity. It's not
        psychotherapy or an attempt to parent
        kids. Nor is it a substitute for core
        academic subjects such as math,
        science, or literacy.
        •Instead, SEL concepts provide an extra
        dimension to education, focusing on
        improving cooperation,
        communication, and decision-making.
        In a world where emotional intelligence
        is critical for lifelong happiness,
        successful careers, and healthier
        relationships, SEL gives students a
        framework for developing these skills.</p>

    <h1>Social Emotional Learning Theory</h1>
    <p>In the 1960s, James Comer expanded this theory
      exponentially. During his time at Yale School of
      Medicine's Child Study Center, Comer wrote an
      academic paper for Scientific American. It centered on
      how “the contrast between a child's experiences at
      home and those in school deeply affects the child's
      psychosocial development and that this in turn shapes
      academic achievement.”
      From there, Yale's Development Program focused on
      two low-scoring schools with the intention to improve
      attendance and academic scoring by changing school
      procedures. They altered social and academic programs
      that may have accelerated bad behavior and as a result,
      these two schools exceeded national averages by the
      early 1980s. Truancy and behavioral issues were also
      reduced, starting an entire movement and credence to
      social-emotional education.
      It is still an evolving study, and there is plenty of room
      for improvement as the application of this form of
      education expands.</p>

          <h1>Social-Emotional Skills Can Be Learned</h1>
          <p>
            •Children learn social-emotional
            skills in a variety of ways,
            including the behavior they see
            modeled by the adults in their
            lives. But social-emotional skills
            and concepts can also be taught
            explicitly in the classroom, in
            much the same way math or
            reading is taught.
